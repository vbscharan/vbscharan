Given a string consisting of lowercase english alphabets, reverse only the vowels present in it and print the resulting string.

Example 1:

Input:
S = "geeksforgeeks"
Output: geeksforgeeks
Explanation: The vowels are: e, e, o, e, e
Reverse of these is also e, e, o, e, e.

Example 2:

Input: 
S = "practice"
Output: prectica
Explanation: The vowels are a, i, e
Reverse of these is e, i, a.
 

Example 3:

Input: 
S = "bcdfg"
Output: bcdfg
Explanation: There are no vowels in S.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function modify() which takes the string S as input and returns the resultant string by reversing only the vowels present in S.


Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(|S|).


Constraints:
1<=|S|<=105



SOLUTION
====================


def modify(self, s):
        # code here
        i=0
        s=list(s)
        j=len(s)-1
        while(i<j):
            if(s[i] in ['a','e','i','o','u']):
                if(s[j] in ['a','e','i','o','u']):
                    s[i],s[j]=s[j],s[i]
                    i+=1;j-=1
                else:
                    j-=1
            else:
                i+=1
        return ''.join(s)
